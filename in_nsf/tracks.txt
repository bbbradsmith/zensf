# [NSF filename] [song] [mm:ss] [0-2=PAL method] [0/1=loop] [arist] [track name] [shortened track name (optional)]
#   Fields are separated by spaces, use enclosing quotes for fields that require internal spaces (e.g. track names)
#   [song] field starts at 1
#   [PAL method]
#     0 PAL will INIT with X=1 (dual mode NSF)
#     1 PAL will INIT with X=0, 5/6 frame doubling (pitch is naturally lowered, tuned DPCM will not work)
#     2 Like 1 but with a workaround to manually switch the pitch table (tuned DPCM will work, Famitracker only)
#     - All tracks are assumed NTSC capable, there is no adjustment method for PAL to NTSC
#     - Dendy playback will always override this with mode 1, since they share pitch tuning with NTSC.
#   A \ in artist/track names will normally be treated as a newline.
#
# ALLCAPS
#   Converts artist/title texts to uppercase. (Applied before MAP.)
#
# MAP [symbol] [replacement]
#   Maps occurencs of a string with its replacement string. (Useful if your title has non-ascii characters you need to remap.)
#
# ORDER [track #] [track #] ...
#   May reorder the tracks differently than they are listed in the file.
#   First track line in the file is track 1.
#
# GAP [seconds]
#   Seconds appended to each track as a gap.
#
# #
#   Text following a # will be treated as a comment until the end of line.
